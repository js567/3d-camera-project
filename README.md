# 3d-camera-project

Note - I renamed the repo so there may be weird remnants with another name

Work for digital clone of Eli's cool film camera.
Takes input from several 1080p webcams and captures images at the same time from different perspectives.
This allows the images to be combined to form a neat 3d gif of the scene.
OpenCV is used for camera control, but a future version might also use it to line up the shots and do some post processing work.
Maybe the program will also generate a gif and save it directly to save the trouble of making them manually.
